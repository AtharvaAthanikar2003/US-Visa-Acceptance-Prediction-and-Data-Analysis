# US-Visa-Acceptance-Prediction-and-Data-Analysis
- I designed an interactive and visually captivating dashboard for US Visa Acceptance Prediction and Data Analysis. It includes parameters such as case ID, continent, employee's education, job experience, job training requirement, number of employees, region of employment, employee wages, full-time position, and case status.
- I have developed a Python code using machine learning in a Jupyter Notebook to predict whether a particular employee will obtain a US visa or not. The libraries used include NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
- Given is the dataset in .csv sheet, perform the data analysis in Microsoft Power BI or Tableau with the help of ETL process.
